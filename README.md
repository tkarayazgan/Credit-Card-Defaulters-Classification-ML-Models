# Credit Card Default Prediction
This project tackles a classification problem: predicting whether a credit card client will default on their payment. For this task, the Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset is used, which contains 30,000 examples and 24 features.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information on clientsâ€™ financial and demographic characteristics, and the target variable for prediction is labeled as "default.payment.next.month". This column indicates whether a client will fail to pay their credit card bills in the upcoming month, serving as the binary outcome variable (default or no default).

# Goal
The primary objective is to build a model that accurately estimates the likelihood of default based on the provided features, enabling proactive management of credit risk.

# Results
While the final metric score may not be particularly high, this project provided valuable insights into the challenges associated with problematic datasets.
